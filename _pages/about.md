I am a first-year Statistics PhD student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical (Bayesian) statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. I am currently completing doctoral-level coursework and pursuing research with professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/). For the first year of my graduate studies, I am fortunate to be sponsored by the Bank of Italy's ["Giorgio Mortara" scholarship](https://www.bancaditalia.it/chi-siamo/lavorare-bi/borse-di-studio/stringher-mortara-menichella/).

Before moving to Austin, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home) in Milan, Italy. While a visiting student at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/) under the supervision of professor [Igor Pr√ºnster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/), I wrote my MSc thesis on probabilistic and methodological aspects of Bayesian nonparametric statistics. In 2022-23, I was also part of the European Research Grant [LOSS Project](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-projects/loss) team, led by professor [Catherine De Vries](https://www.catherinedevries.eu/).
