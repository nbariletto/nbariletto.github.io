Hi! I am a first-year Statistics PhD student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Sciences](https://stat.utexas.edu/) at the University of Texas at Austin. My research interests lie at the intersection of mathematical (Bayesian) statistics, applied probability, and machine learning. I am currently completing doctoral-level coursework and pursuing research with professor [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/).

Before moving to Austin, I completed my Bachelor's and Master's studies at [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home) in Milan, Italy. While a visiting student at the [Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics](https://bidsa.unibocconi.eu/) under the supervision of professor [Igor Pr√ºnster](https://mypage.unibocconi.eu/igorpruenster/), I wrote my MSc thesis on the probabilistic foundations and methodological advances of Bayesian nonparametric statistics.
